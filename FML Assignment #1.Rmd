# The Loan data file that was used for this assignment was downloaded from kaggle via https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavikjikadara/loan-status-prediction/data

# In this Loan Status Prediction dataset, we have the data of applicants who previously applied for loan based on the property that they own which was also acquired via a Property Loan.The bank will decide whether to give a loan to the applicant based on some factors such as Applicant Income, Loan Amount, previous Credit History, Co-applicant Income, etcâ€¦

# The meaning of the various columns in the loan_data.csv file are given as follows: Loan_ID: A unique loan ID. Gender: Either male or female. Married: Whether Married(yes) or Not Married(No). Dependents: Number of persons depending on the client. Education: Applicant Education Level (Graduate or Undergraduate). Self_Employed: Self-employed (Yes/No). ApplicantIncome: Applicant income. CoapplicantIncome: Co-applicant income. LoanAmount: Loan amount in thousands. Loan_Amount_Term: Terms of the loan in months. Credit_History: Credit history meets guidelines. Property_Area: Applicants are living either Urban, Semi-Urban or Rural. Loan_Status: Loan approved (Y/N).

# Import the dataset into R

data <- read.csv("C:/Users/kamam/Downloads/MSBA/RStudio/Datasets/loan_data.csv")

# Quantitative Variables

# Given that 'data' is the data frame, Let 'ApplicantIncome', 'CoapplicantIncome' and 'LoanAmount' be the quantitative variables to be analysed.

# Applicant Income
mean(data$ApplicantIncome)  # Mean
median(data$ApplicantIncome)  # Median
sd(data$ApplicantIncome)  # Standard deviation
var(data$ApplicantIncome)  # Variance
min(data$ApplicantIncome)  # Minimum
max(data$ApplicantIncome)  # Maximum

# Co-applicant Income
mean(data$CoapplicantIncome)  # Mean
median(data$CoapplicantIncome)  # Median
sd(data$CoapplicantIncome)  # Standard deviation
var(data$CoapplicantIncome)  # Variance
min(data$CoapplicantIncome)  # Minimum
max(data$CoapplicantIncome)  # Maximum

# Loan Amount
mean(data$LoanAmount)  # Mean
median(data$LoanAmount)  # Median
sd(data$LoanAmount)  # Standard deviation
var(data$LoanAmount)  # Variance
min(data$LoanAmount)  # Minimum
max(data$LoanAmount)  # Maximum

# Categorical Variables

# Given that 'data' is the data frame, Let 'Gender', 'Married', 'Self_Employed', 'Property_Area' be the categorical variables to be analysed. We can use the table() function to get a frequency table for the categorical variables.

table(data$Gender)
table(data$Married)
table(data$Self_Employed)
table(data$Property_Area)

# Transform at least one variable: Assume that all the loan applicants decided to request double of the initial loan amount

data <- transform(data, New_Loan_Amount = LoanAmount * 2)

# Plotting some quantitative variable and one scatterplot

library(ggplot2) # Load the necessary library

# To plot histogram and boxplot of a quantitative variable 'ApplicantIncome'

ggplot(data, aes(x=ApplicantIncome)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=500, color="black", fill="white") +
  labs(x="Applicant Income", y="Frequency", title="Histogram of Applicant Income")

ggplot(data, aes(y=ApplicantIncome)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(y="Applicant Income", title="Boxplot of Applicant Income")

# To create a  scatterplot of two quantitative variables 'ApplicantIncome' and 'LoanAmount'

ggplot(data, aes(x=ApplicantIncome, y=LoanAmount)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x="Applicant Income", y="Loan Amount", title="Scatter plot of Applicant Income vs Loan Amount")
